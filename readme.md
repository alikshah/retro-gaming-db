# Project: Transition to a Digital Era for RetroGaming Emporium

**Grade Weight:** This individual project will account for **30% of your total grade** for the module. **Project Overview:**  

RetroGaming Emporium, owned by Alex, has been a traditional haven for vintage gaming enthusiasts. The business, which specializes in crafting and supplying arcade machines to both corporate clients and private individuals, has been relying on a paper-based system for its operations. Recognizing the increasing demands and the need for efficiency, Alex has decided to embrace modernization by transitioning to a computerized database and website. 

To  facilitate  the  production  of  arcade  machines,  RetroGaming  Emporium  collaborates  with  several suppliers to source various components. Alex has shared a glimpse of the supplier book, providing details on these essential partnerships: 



|**Supplier Number** |**Supplier  Name** |**Suppler Address** |**Supplier Telephone** |**Part(s)**  **Number** |**Part  Name(s)** |**Part Price(s)** |

***Table 1:  Supplier Book Sample*** 

In RetroGaming Emporium’s business, he has two types of customers: corporate and private. A sample of his customer book is given below. 



|**Customer  Number** |**Company/ Customer Name** |**Customer Telephone** |**Corporate Contact Person** |**Corporate  Balance** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**130** |1-UP Arcade Bar |087-2230078 |Sarah O Brien |12,500 |

***Table 2:  Customer Book Sample*** 

As Alex didn’t have his order book to hand, he just tells that for each arcade machine he sells, he records the order number (which is unique), the arcade machine name, arcade machine type, and the customer who bought the machine. Alex sometimes gives credit to his corporate customers and allows them to pay the balance 30 days later. For some private customers who have been around a long time, Alex can also give some discount; he would like to keep this below 25%, but sometimes he goes higher. Alex would prefer to keep his corporate customer balances and contact person separate from the rest of his data, as he sometimes employs part-time staff who he would prefer did not see this information. Alex would also like to generate reports (and he stresses that he should be the only one that can do this) showing all his customer information, be it corporate or private individuals. Keep in mind that the Database you design must allow for the processing of any payments. 

**Part 1: Requirements Engineering** 

1) Conduct a simple interview with the owner of the RetroGaming Emporium to learn more 

   about what he wants from the new computerized database. Have a minimum of 5 questions 

   with sample answers.                                                                                                                **[10 Marks]**                             

2) Write  down  at  least  12  requirements  of  the  system.  Categorize  these  requirements  as 

   necessary into (General, Data, Report and Security Requirements).                                **[12 Marks]** 

3) Write down 3 business rules that you have identified.                                                         **[3 Marks]** 

**Part 2: Entities and Relationships** 

4) Identify all entities in the current system**.                                                                           [10 Marks]** 
4) Determine how these entities are related to each other using **Chen Notation Diagram**.**  

`                                                                                                                                                                        `**[15 Marks]           Part 3:  Data Modeling** 

6) Utilize **Crow’s Foot Notation** to construct a more specific data model. Include attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality. You can use any software such as[ draw.io.](https://app.diagrams.net/)               **[30 Marks]** 

**Part 4: Normalization** 

7) Normalize all the tables including the sample tables (***Table 1 and 2***) to **3NF notation**. Show the new 3NF tables with sample data.                                                                                             **[20 Marks]****
